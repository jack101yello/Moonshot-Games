	<p>
		Legatus is a Processing-based chat application that runs via port 4444 on the local network.
		At the moment, two known bugs are present: first, typing is awkward. Second, the IP address
		of the host cannot be added automatically, and so it requires access to the source code.
		Both of these issues are being looked into.
